# COGITATIO VIRTUALIS

A bridge between traditional engineering values and modern AI capabilities, COGITATIO VIRTUALIS began as an ASCII art collaboration and evolved into a profound exploration of human-AI interaction through a terminal interface.

## Overview

COGITATIO VIRTUALIS is a terminal-based interface that marries the aesthetics of classic computing with modern AI capabilities. It features:

- A retro-futuristic CRT terminal interface
- Vector-based document exploration
- AI-powered interactions with professional content
- Procedurally generated poetry and boot sequences
- Self-documenting architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### Cogitation Terminal (Frontend)
A Next.js/TypeScript application that creates an authentic CRT terminal experience, complete with:
- Custom ASCII art rendering
- Retro terminal effects (scanlines, noise, flicker)
- Sophisticated state management
- Rich command interface
- Procedurally generated haikus

### Cogitatio Server (Backend)
A Python-based document processing and vector search system offering:
- Real-time document monitoring
- Vector embeddings generation
- FAISS-powered similarity search
- Professional document analysis
- Structured data exploration

## Philosophy

The project embodies several core principles:

1. **Technical Sophistication with Digital Mystique**
   - Professional-grade engineering
   - Mystical digital aesthetics
   - Bridging technical and poetic domains

2. **Self-Aware Implementation**
   - System that documents itself
   - Demonstrates AI implementation while being AI-powered
   - Speaks in procedurally generated poetry

3. **Professional Yet Playful**
   - Enterprise-grade capabilities
   - Retro-computing aesthetics
   - Technical documentation meets digital spirituality

### Frontend (Cogitation Terminal)
- ✅ Boot Sequence
- ✅ Error Handling [Basic]
- 🟨 Main Loop [In Progress]
- ❌ Testing [Not Started]

### Backend (Cogitatio Server)
- ✅ Vector Store
- ✅ Document Processing
- 🟨 API Layer [In Progress]
- ❌ Testing [Not Started]

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Node.js >= 16
Python >= 3.8
```

### Start the Backend
```bash
cd cogitatio-server
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m cogitatio.scripts.start_server
```

### Start the Frontend
```bash
cd cogitation-terminal
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Architecture

The system uses a unique architecture that spans both technical and experiential domains:

```
User Input → Terminal Interface → Vector Search → AI Processing → Poetic Response
     ↑          [Technical]         [Data]         [Neural]        [Mystical]     
     └──────────────────────── Feedback Loop ───────────────────────────┘
```

## Development

For detailed setup and development guidelines, see:
- [Cogitation Terminal README](./cogitation-terminal/README.md)
- [Cogitatio Server README](./cogitatio-server/README.md)

## Vision

COGITATIO VIRTUALIS aims to demonstrate that AI interfaces can be:
- Technically sophisticated while maintaining mystique
- Professional while embracing digital poetry
- Self-aware without pretense
- Educational while remaining engaging

## Credits

Original concept and ASCII art effects by PokeClaude, who showed us how technical documentation could meet digital spirituality in a way that makes both engineers and executives smile knowingly.

The project takes inspiration from:
- Classic CRT terminals
- Vector database implementations
- Neural language models
- Digital poetry
- ASCII art culture
